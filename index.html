			<h2>Third Week</h2>
			<div>
				My first week at NSS was filled with a lot of ups and downs. Monday was the first time I had ever installed anything via the terminal, so it was a bit daunting. On Tuesday, we had a past "NSSer", Meghan, show us the basics of git / github. I had messed around with github over the past year, but had NO idea how to actually make it work. It is difficult to say the least, but by Friday, I felt like I knew the bare minimum to get things pushed and pulled. On Wednesday, Callan came in to teach us about CSS. She showed us how to use Flexbox, and made it look a lot easier than it actually is! By Thursday morning, I was feeling really confident and could see all the prework had paid off... that was until Steve's JavaScript lesson. I was following the code he was writing and it made sense, but once we were working on our own JS exercises, I realized Treehouse was just a bunch of "monkey see, monkey do" lessons. Because of this, I was definitely nervous going into Friday. I was releived to find out we were breaking into our first group project, that was more HTML / CSS heavy. Once we broke out into groups, we planned out our project and made our pet fashion product, FURban Outfitters.
